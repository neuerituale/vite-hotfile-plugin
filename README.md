# vite hotfile plugin
The Vite Hot File Plugin creates a file (vite.hot by default) containing the development server's URL. This file is stored in the public directory and is automatically deleted when the server shuts down.

## Key Features:
âœ… Generates a hotfile with the current server URL when Vite starts.  
âœ… Ensures automatic cleanup on server shutdown (exit, SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP).  
âœ… Customizable options (directory, filename, logging).  
âœ… Prevents race conditions using fs.promises.rm() for safe file deletion.  

This plugin is useful for tools or scripts that need access to the live server URL, ensuring a smooth development experience. ðŸš€
